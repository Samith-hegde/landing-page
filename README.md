# landing-page

This is my second mini-project in web development. This This is part of the prescribed curriculum in The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The project is entitled Landing Page.

I have used basic HTML and CSS syntax for the content and display style of the website, and the Flexbox module to structure it into an appropriate, visually appealing and user-friendly layout.
